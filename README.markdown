# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

This project is a dashboard for analyzing coffee shop sales data. 
my program can generates random sales, analyze sales metrics, add invidiual sales, supports trending products, 
loads sample datasets, and visualizes data with interactive charts using Dash and Plotly.

- python 3.8 or higher
- **pip**: Ensure `pip` is installed (usually included with Python).

	- This creates a virtual environment (`venv`) to isolate dependencies, 
	ensuring no impact on your system.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - run 'run_program'

4. **Uninstallation**:
	-To remove the project and its dependencies:
		-Double-click cleanup.bat to delete the virtual environment (venv) and generated files (e.g., output Excel files).

	-The virtual environment ensures no system-wide changes persist.
